<img src="picasso_sculpture.jpg" alt="picasso" height="700" width= "900"><br>
<h4>The Museum of Modern Art’s staggering “Picasso Sculpture” is in the third category. <br>
Large, ambitious and unavoidably, dizzyingly peripatetic, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event. <br>
It sustains its vision through a ring of 11 grand spaces on the museum’s fourth floor, tracing the serial genre-bending forays into three dimensions wrought by this 20th-century titan of painting. <br>
Each bout lasted a few years and was different from the one before, and each has been given its own gallery, more or less.<br>

<a href="http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1613">Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty Through Sunday, July 24</a></h2><br>
<h4>Edgar Degas is best known as a painter and chronicler of the ballet, yet his work as a printmaker reveals the true extent of his restless experimentation.<br> In the mid-1870s, Degas was introduced to the monotype process—drawing in ink on a metal plate that was then run through a press, typically resulting in a single print.<br> Captivated by the monotype’s potential, he immersed in the technique with enormous enthusiasm, taking the medium to radical ends. <br>He expanded the possibilities of drawing, created surfaces with a heightened sense of tactility, and invented new means for new subjects, from dancers in motion to the radiance of electric light, from women in intimate settings to meteorological effects in nature.<br> The monotype also sparked a host of experiments for Degas, who often used the medium as a starting point from which an image could be reworked and revised.<br>
The exhibition includes approximately 120 rarely seen monotypes—along with some 60 related paintings, drawings, pastels, sketchbooks, and prints—that show Degas at his most modern, capturing the spirit of urban life; depicting the body in new and daring ways; liberating mark-making from tradition; and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction.<br>
